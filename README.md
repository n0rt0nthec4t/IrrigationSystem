## Parts

Built with readily available 'off the shelf' parts, housed in a sealed ABS enclosure. As the system is housed externally to the house and exposed to yhe weather, 240v wiring to the 24v AC transformer has also been house in a seperate sealed ABS enclosure for extra protection

- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- 24v AC transformer (Hunter irrigation one)
- LM2596HV AC/DC stepdown buck converter (DC output adjusted to 5v)
- JSN-SR04T ultrasonic sensor
- 8 channel solid-state relay board (highlevel trigger)
- Water flow sensor - pulsed output
- Waterproof push-on/push-off LED lit switch
- Mains power cable
- Irrigation wire

## Ultrasonic Waterlevel Measuring

I've included 'C' source code (usonic_measure.c) for a program which reads distances via an ultrasonic sensor. I used a JSN-SR04T waterproof ultrasonic sensor in my progect. The particular model has a minimum reading distance of 200mm and a maximum distance of 4500mm. This is mounted ontop of my watertank at 200mm above the maximum waterlevel for the tank.

This program requires the wiringPI library to be installed before compiliation of the program
- sudo apt install wiringPI

It can be compiled with:
- gcc -o dist/usonic_measure -lwiringPi usonic_measure.c
